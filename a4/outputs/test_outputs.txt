You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like a farmer, or with leather <unk> and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell in a place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird <unk>
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom, <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
for three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could hold it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> ovarian cancer, I'd like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, <unk> <unk> and realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> us from his family, because necessary, because necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and put it into my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you talked about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work -- to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature, and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around me <unk> about 60 meters -- and I could not even think that it was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> in snow after year.
<unk> are born when you fall out of the glaciers or <unk> the ice <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold onto the end, whereas others can't get more <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated from separated and they, largely as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As it melts in a <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts up a iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it would be the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments, there are just that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
Another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
We are very <unk> to actually see a <unk> iceberg <unk>
Here they have.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starting to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg iceberg <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much on the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about consciousness itself, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm are brought to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X <unk> joins the X X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that I can put two <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- the anatomy -- how they think of human bodies -- the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that in my job is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> to people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physics discover it doesn't fit into the male schemes and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in common forms or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome -- and tell the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that goes into <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles make it testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't respond to testosterone, the body doesn't respond to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but no reaction to them.
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically female course.
When you <unk> the baby there is a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not as far as puberty, when it's growing and developing the <unk> but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something's happening.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like I -- I -- I think I consider a <unk> woman, I don't know his <unk> <unk> I think, being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationship with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes, and on the uterus, the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, its genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone <unk> as a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that in fact, she was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that is called <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgeries -- not to have a better physical health <unk>
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy to bring <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> <unk> <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children born like two people in the same body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> South African <unk> stood in <unk> her sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to ask, "What are you going to do to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there's no such one.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- as a little bit of a little thought were stable categories that would fit directly into <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, which is a lot more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What are it going to do in fact, from <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a <unk> zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles to principle and in order to life.
It's hard to get a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- it's not in public, but it is in public, but when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved on, they still don't get it.
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a dilemma for a really good thing, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be able to be somebody like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that I got nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about being <unk>
I <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find each of these <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is completely <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
Parents <unk> came to me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> it with another who was radical and beautiful and kept it for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what we <unk> our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know about DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they came up with political power for the blood of blood passed from the grandfather to father and then to the son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many people were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed on by a vague <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And the consequence was broadcasting us the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing that, they were <unk> the foundation of the future rights movement <unk>
They didn't think they thought about it, but it was really cool.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people on the <unk> <unk> <unk> which said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that we <unk> the coincidence of coincidence about the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean by the age of five years they were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary. were born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, the other thing was born in term: was born on March March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right for the right to <unk> the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, the virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's a <unk> in virtue of being considered a man is now <unk> <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, do you don't have the same rights rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in various ways, are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is sort of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to get married with a man doesn't have to have chromosome <unk> and to marry a woman is to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests to the people.
But this is also very strange because of the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be interested in this to provide rights to people, because I have to admit that I know that I know some of the social services that some humans I have ever met.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships than people of 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of one person could in the future would be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this stream of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who is being attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to have a change of sex, in which case they are allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to <unk> <unk> twins to then pick them up, and so <unk> her name.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it was considered the political asylum.
The United States provides huge possibilities for people to be who they are <unk> to change the good of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation in <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> of <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I thought of the question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, on average, something different between the female brain and male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I knew the Founding they were very aware of finding the way to protect the people from the state, it's possible that there was more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have <unk> the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the <unk> think less in the individual body -- in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So while we tried to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where you want to go live and work to work, has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for to attract new choices.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd that you have never thought about new cities.
But just just just put it out of the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that in the other half still no lack of it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas surrounding them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all these <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a completely new apartment building a new apartment building always and when the standards of that place will be able to put <unk>
So I suggested that governments were <unk> new enough reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next few weeks we had <unk> <unk> imposed on a platform in which they were growing <unk> and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most pressing ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say they can't go and signed up to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies as a norms for <unk> and usually are the rules that prevent us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of mine sent him a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, a conference conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go out and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value in a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is just over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is about about 1,000 miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public was very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to North America.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that would help them to establish and make the norms norms so that everybody could trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be <unk> a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow to create these special <unk> regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting <unk> at the age of 21, an <unk> <unk> in the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big city center of the city that's being built in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after it was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other interest in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and at the time it would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last <unk> system.
There are <unk> and <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free place, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would immediately change somewhere else.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're often mothers who have to win the money for just to eat their clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between a number of cities that are competing for new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find -- and more recently, photographing and post on my blog and colorful and different for every single time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are usually going to get my money on a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what about someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes inside and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I figured it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you got to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know as the woman who walks by TED in my underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you're not just <unk> you will get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember your <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you see yourself with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again when people came up to me this week just because of what he was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave the way out of certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there's always going to be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side -- which is the logic, and the right side -- which is the intuitive part of it.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So, where's your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, his brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logical physicists -- these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
So how do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see them as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing that says that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a parking little bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet I play with that bar in the parking lot, he taught him a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with these <unk> <unk> play with these strange little particles.
And when you play with their particles, you discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it the quantum mechanics.
At that point the physics was a few years ago -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't have been.
And so I felt much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a pretty good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little piece of metal, a form of springboard and that shows up on a platform.
And so I did this almost as a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it takes a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> on inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that the <unk> and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air, and we took it into a temperature of less than a degree above zero absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like <unk>
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it <unk> it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't get it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In an case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
Over the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is what it means is that all the metal piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it, and we turned the lights into and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all of the things around you, literally define them who you are. And that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that I was here and that allowed me to take it out.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories are <unk> with 17 museums very interesting museums countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explained to just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, <unk> I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo for then to tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So <unk> are we going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> gallery -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the upper plane, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things like they're going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And so I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you can actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create its own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we've just got a zooming around you.
This is the <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel in contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all of the incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, I don't even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from these artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital brain do justice for its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a <unk> pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy are growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that there's something very interesting has happened in year careers in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car, a car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the career.
This is what in engineering, they were <unk> of control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As something else, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, starting to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he dropped it in the <unk> -- you can still see a little bit of a dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and so they don't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something out.
Let's start with the detection of the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer, hopefully, in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
So late late there are people over here and doing <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First amount of time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yes!
That night everybody was <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everybody went to the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the input of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a series of volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and we got a <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
And after a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that before not exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we will throw it not away, that's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we put on a day still still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe has a beautiful tradition of water using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels land you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can pass on, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they set up a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you approach it it opens up so that you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see the people <unk> so it goes into the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to <unk> when you test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept making <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be able to a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get close, and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers of today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture its movements in 3D and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we have to play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment <unk> like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible by the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, we can go through the digital world, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something that's built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud of our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move around, you can have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the core moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new peak of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many do you choose memory?
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something from this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except to light <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch right on one end, is, of course, the most interest to us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the third have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin using it to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is <unk> <unk> which goes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think ... when Antonio <unk> is drawn to the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's very dark warm, moist, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort of it.
It's really like a quick thing for bacteria with the occasional occasional <unk> of a rush rush to the way.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and unique life, and human life, a little note of grace.
That's us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in organisms -- every single cell is splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two stem cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into paper <unk>
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the human body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right in his 90 years.
And one night, someone hits your door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it is a magnificent <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"It says, George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just differently.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted them to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as the reinforcing rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> it doesn't <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily affect longevity.
It doesn't necessarily affect the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the <unk>
Evolution favors intelligent creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward at the <unk> phase, I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen to happen.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of the traditional type, natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the <unk> of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as they <unk> as a species -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution as well.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male boys than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual and a family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes for eliminating diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes on your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the next year of having finished, in 2004, I could get the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of <unk> and a week.
Not much to be a lot of the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more and more at all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine against flu -- in cells of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthy life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're going to pass this to the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can save 1,000 years old, and maybe it was happening within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better and more successful, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. We probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words that you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George <unk> bridge, which was not a long -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve all I did.
But in my humanity I also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about time that it doesn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to be wrong, <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of <unk> <unk> not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just a wish of one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason for being the world.
At that point, I understood that two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not dying that day.
And I was <unk> another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in otherwise.
You are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please be not so -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you supposed to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate to me."
And I said, "Wait a second, it's not that you have seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Anybody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're <unk> with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to me with the only wanting to deliver a check and instead sign a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I <unk> with his brother and his father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony <unk> we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around doing art installations like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and, in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of a lot of moving things from one side to another we had a couple of things.
One is, I went to the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that it would be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and I moved to the garage <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have removed the walls of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
It's a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera. We put it into a LED light -- and there's now a device that's free -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and it builds yourself, we published the code <unk> the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say.
There's no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate with only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming, I was two weeks of programming, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a parking wall outside the hospital.
And he went back in front of his first time in front of his family and friends and imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
And since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine occurred to us as one of the best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles there's going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> <unk> I just recognized something, and I was amazed with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we're feeling that you need to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in which in very often very difficult situations and at the same time a lot of dangerous.
I went to <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days by eating just this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in awful situations with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we have to make interesting attractive, and hopefully let's measure them in a way that is kind of entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So, some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered them to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I had no <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the <unk> of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something so dangerous or as dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I think about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom of the end, has images of brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
Was it <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the brand of the brand of brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we would take out all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe I <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most cool car you have led to the largest <unk> film ever <unk> the best drink you have ever <unk> from "The largest <unk> movie.
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film whole is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, the whole shot shot in the end.
And I would love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> Very <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet them, but certainly it's worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that movie comes out of the film will look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
And Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be me?
JK:
MS: That means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where we go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside having a conversation.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was present to the product as well as possible, to make as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the social media scenario is not the idea to have that new <unk> vehicle that is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a mistake for me, and that mistake was this.
Actually there was no such one mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were <unk>
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> the president -- the <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives rise --  -- like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk>
We want you to take a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was <unk> in some lie -- and there is he looking at me as he used to look like, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I began to warn you suddenly is -- and that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films -- big, giants and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big, giant <unk> they say that the reason their movies are so successful because the marks are so successful because of the brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> giant <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I get to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you give you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before you <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for a man like <unk> solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
It <unk> the smallest type of movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other <unk>
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why we do this.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep them fresh longer? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who were <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is your brand <unk>
<unk> A few <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the colored colors -- many gray colors.
Usually I wear accessories like sunglasses, or like sunglasses, or like <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: <unk> <unk> in part <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the same guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: So my brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a Nigerian brand -- but I often <unk> myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped him business like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If you could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world is, I think your world is the world in which we think about as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and start in my case where they come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like things like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> why do you make it?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important -- what is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
There is to be scared -- what kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Big <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but <unk> in your personality. <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies are just <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually <unk> and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and brands care, those things that have gone and come but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand identity, your personality personality would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or you are more well a <unk> attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are how to be playful being cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk>
Or you are more <unk> attribute to <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you are <unk>
You're <unk> stable, <unk> safe, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they had no control, they would not have control over the end.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film -- how now they use MRI resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as much as a movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in schools with problems in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or that I've been more successful is the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these <unk>
They went to the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we're talking about, <unk> their customers won't be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to people that's pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss is preparing their entire company to reward <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, I think we need to give rise to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> <unk>
From <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And he said that, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I put in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED to the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
Those gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box so we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
All I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory in the lab who didn't like our <unk> the wave, the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be -- let's say for example, a <unk> power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we've pulled up and <unk> the seizure code, and we found that I was going to be <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small one and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the current information.
They <unk> all the points that I attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to address the real world, with potential real world goals.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about learning, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the <unk> nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and puzzle in an obvious way to go back to the talent engineers so that they could not solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, can't be <unk>
I started doing scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what did we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And it didn't get <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> up dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> were pointing to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
That's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input input of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code -- which is still running during attack, with fake data data.
And believe it or not, this fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the great steam turbine goes out of speed, you have to open escape escape from a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
So that's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And I don't have the <unk> and the security system was <unk>
<unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> it is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and we should better start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower line.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give you a <unk> ability or another one that makes a wheelchair users get up and flip back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and help him, for example, handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and other <unk>
This is not an idea.
To show you now what we're working on is we started talking about the American soldier who are on average, must carry on their back a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from the <unk>
So we decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 50 kilos on top land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Go back to the users of chairs. I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people, roughly, in <unk> across the world.
As one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage to the column that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be the only choice.
We also talk about the population that are <unk> which is just spreading quickly.
Its only option, many times -- a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago, had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he could not go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board here, here on the back.
There's also a lot of batteries that give you energy to the motors in the <unk> and the knees, and they make it move forward and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing across the air, skiing down <unk>
At a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and all the movement from <unk> down.
A few time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
I was stole to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climb rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life in future generations, not just by soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to know their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society, the Bonobo Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence hasn't yet been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario that has been lasting for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction is also a danger of the <unk> of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation will make you not fill a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos -- you can hear the laughter hidden in <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
With him learning <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of <unk> diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the <unk> roots of the laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a game of <unk> <unk> and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much as humans.
And this video is really interesting because this is really interesting because this is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's take it to the maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans equally, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you seem to be less appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent times as it is.
So in primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are <unk> to highly skilled staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so he had a rather high chance of going.
But there was still a career on foot against the other volunteers to get the captain to charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and would save the dog house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live job, just because I won by five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen -- I went to the fire firemen -- that even more or less had finished turning on the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures of house <unk> where, as they would expect, his treasure received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the <unk> of the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as <unk> <unk> I witness a acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> <unk> acts of <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be right now.
They eat food in a dining hall, <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
Now, this might seem strange, but I'm a big <unk> of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete is built into <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> what happened to me.
It was called a brick of assembly itself.
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that there have been over 400 billion or 75 dollars per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build bridges <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world, stacked up with each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex circuits at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor transistor was for experts.
I personally don't recognize it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The building blocks have a color code.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange and the orange color is the wire.
So only you have to assemble one blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits in it.
A blue one with green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
Let's get this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
In order to make <unk> faster or slower, just a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> <unk>
We have provided kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how does a light light works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took a <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who has no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "You know, something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> barrel turned through motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the dark.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to do all of all of them.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the <unk> environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I'm already the time for time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
And we had some members every year and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World <unk> we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I look for a quote, but what really looks for is that someone will clean up with it, when it is trapped by the snow because he knows it's not very good because he is covered by a foot of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment it was very much last year.
They realized that the city had never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did just like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's a modest application.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 killer app is last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it spreads viral.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City -- when you see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to take <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> natural and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that I had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California California power of California that at the time has two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that you have in a couple of days and <unk> is <unk> is a kind of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in a open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution that is an institution of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can get together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not given up to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't <unk> it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put away with the government is essentially in essentially words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because we don't have any <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately comes out of -- you remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way it would think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to get <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the health care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put music well and see if they <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has a application, and you have a mobile app called <unk> <unk>
I don't know that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I just approached the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income, a distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to engage and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services that we need but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another person, <unk> communities.
If we call the animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people get it, but you think you're the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds us from that that actually belongs to that that we funded as something that we funded as something that is operating against that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make law sexy.
Because that's where the real work is happening.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
This is a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform.
That's not political <unk> it's really <unk>
And for those of us that have <unk> us to government, is time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of all?
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years old and I, to <unk> I'm a generation generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express their opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem, they don't really care about making your voices heard.
They're using hands.
They set up with the work for software to make applications better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking off <unk> <unk> <unk> which has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will become a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not otherwise be otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if they are taught with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in any conversation in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I got back again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went up through the room, I took my hand to me, and he said, "Come <unk> we are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> will tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just do I want to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that we always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing, even the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a older year and a older sister.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> got to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of all the time.
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel like you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I put it into a force and said, "Oh, you won't be thinking about conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this thinking that it's a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My children died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or the parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, L.A., Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the color young people are in jail or the parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system, which is a lot better if you're rich and guilty, than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
<unk> politics and anger make us believe that these are not our issues of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good developments in the job.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you have a rights rights <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we show it to the next 10 years, the level of a loss of rights will be as high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it was sentence to <unk> <unk> to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no chance to go out again.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent that is innocent and liberated from death row.
<unk> rate, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow me to fly airplanes if you were in the middle of nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it began at the end of the reconstruction and that went to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what was defined its lives.
Now there are some older people who come to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you teaches talks, makes it <unk> <unk> people to stop saying that in our history we deal with the terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time you get one with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We have no death worth of death in Germany.
<unk> never be able to take it up here."
The room stayed quietly and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we were <unk> and <unk> we could put people to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We were fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of these things.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means I'm going to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And if you think about it it is, in a way, something that's inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
We are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
<unk> comes with innovation, development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas as well as the <unk>
This connection from the mind is what drives us to look not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is essentially at the heart of what I think, still in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no <unk> <unk> with technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay for the due attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality by injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a young lawyer to know Rosa <unk>
These women were all together just to talk about.
Occasionally, I was called to me, <unk> to say, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> me to tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom to end up for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in the prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech, and I was going to end up and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> the finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find ways to deal with those challenges, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher at the worst we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because they are a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't scare you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Do they even kill each other, not to be a <unk>
So I think there's basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, because of our design capacity or rational.
At the end of the way, the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with rich and powerful ones, but by the way they deal with the poor, <unk> <unk> prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who isn't it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake at me, <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer a little, black poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there were been fixed behavior, in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there's no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not just <unk> it was sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally my God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got on the car, and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally fell down from the car walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, he was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "Is you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached myself and approached me.
And I would focus on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge came in, he saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started discuss.
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- everybody excited because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I hit the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let you hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a face of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> showed <unk> because the <unk> had come into the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, <unk> this guy in audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to the other people.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view on the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Trying to hear and see an obvious wish of the audience, in this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the California state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which a effort is going to do for <unk> the funds that are spent today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds were <unk> these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones you think is that?
<unk> actually, the <unk> rate of violence has remained relatively stable.
The large growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
Is it for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we are allowed to convince us about the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media would rather be <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses are getting so much more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early early-warning detector that <unk> danger.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that would make any harm.
So from a <unk> stories of stories -- looking at the <unk>
That old adage from <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide us with negative news today, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> certainly we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> gross per capita income, has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy country of 25 percent more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would get it.
And we continue to <unk> every time.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of this technology -- this is the technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed you that any tool that <unk> information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession to be <unk> and <unk>
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop with any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is every time faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computing in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production, all the planet, synthetic biology, fuels them and distribute the digital <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> digital medicine.
I mean, how many did you see victory in "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that they <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody on your cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, it can impact the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each inhabitant on the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
He went to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops were covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate covered in aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is from aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal as well.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and he made something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
I <unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is five times more energy than we used in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that by the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar power will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk now about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager 1 spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after I spent a <unk>
<unk> a famous photo <unk> How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's an existing technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
<unk> nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission for <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small kid.
It's capable of generating a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The CEO of Coke has just thought about a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have trust that it will be, Coca-Cola is doing it in <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an inclusive innovation -- because of this technology that it exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration from the mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications <unk> that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have happened.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, libraries of books and music, robotic diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when I look at the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce to the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams in the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with the <unk> and because it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the health <unk> and first of all, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a <unk> mark on the <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that add to global conversation.
What would these people?
What does it <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy -- because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can us give three billion more members of humanity, healthy <unk> polite and <unk>
How about a voices never before the <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, to wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What about these three billion <unk>
And if you are contributions that we can't afford them.
One thing I learned to the X X is that small, guided teams, guided by their passion with a goal, of course, they can do things like <unk> things that previously could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's really important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this <unk> teachers.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined me, and started <unk>
And it has shown that the machinery of human patterns are better at best, protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to be <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
It was caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times in Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept: <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 inches a black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent a good time, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined in half.
<unk> to the 5 <unk>
We have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fisheries, in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that were already <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite kind of ugly, <unk>
I went out on it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and, especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was a little bit <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny spots on a <unk> remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In one year, you make a study and then start commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But there was no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember.
They took the starting point to start on a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the <unk> we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer because they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and on a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of them would have been <unk> just as a captain of how to just look at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, generally they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be able to get a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and very low.
That's for people who can see a protected protected protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the West, for example?
I think there are arts and cinema maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were being touched by the movie -- to talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron, making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today that web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be known on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little bit of a little bit viral is got lots and lots of <unk> visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the <unk> on the rise of the last summer.
<unk> wasn't supposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double bow. <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> to <unk> the <unk>
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> show us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start the Friday.   Everyone wants me to get a week, the weekend a week --  --  <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: <unk> Friday. <unk> on top of this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the use of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators will embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke then starts to talk about it and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three million hours that has been seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there's cats seen other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up among the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then it was international.
Suddenly a whole community of <unk> who made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted -- <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to be <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video are going up in a minute, just the very unique thing and unexpected the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I get <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that hold you circular from properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all how new we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, is that we're totally unexpected, it's features of a new kind of media type, and that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the <unk> <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the current media -- but <unk> entertainment in the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose whole life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long, my friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget about his story.
My job was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is on a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two tiny little kids.
For her, life was destined to be <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat fled to the sea <unk> from <unk>
All the adults know the risks.
The most fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was carrying a <unk> with poison.
So if we first came back, we would take it to my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, he will end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried, because by the <unk> men from the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is made of <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments were <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days -- double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree at IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't care what was supposed to be <unk> that usually was a second hand.
Two base pairs for school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years old.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
<unk>
Something in me is <unk>
I was <unk> determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I were <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's <unk>
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares began to be able to get <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the <unk> angry and <unk> boys and <unk> <unk>
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They were created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the student <unk> <unk> <unk> with what it was about myself.
On the other hand, it was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer of lawyer they were elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges are not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters just ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she had the boat.
<unk> had never been an option.
<unk> said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to talk about it.
I met people of all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a <unk>
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly <unk> new ones on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a ship <unk>
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, a very rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I continued my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it made a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
They were going to go well at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we open ourselves up.
He took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matters.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to <unk> and take the cause for itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot have proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room, in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise their hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why is his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life is built together now we can see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave at each wave, the <unk> rate of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it up and see them -- they would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when you put the great prince warrior <unk> it was <unk> pulling up a bow and a <unk> on the ground, collect water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that gave me a lot of it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
I felt like technology had to allow the magic to be <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological age was for my most <unk> thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones have the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them off of it.
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I <unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that we can connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that cause us?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so this --  says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
In a number of moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is thrilled with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to liberate fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what the dynamics of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book is transformed into a <unk> that I drag towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every book of fantasy -- there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes down, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over the millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And, talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that the children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, I have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside of the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, you have to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through it, you can actually see a group of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves behind it.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology come to one another.
We <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat down through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning <unk> me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> me send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him too. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- I would see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it is pressure on the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From the week next to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> is connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for example.
This is the point where patients take a position, they go back to the control of control and to be captains of its own <unk> but it also can help health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing costs of attention to the <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we made I'd like to share with you with a video with a video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are <unk> <unk>
Also, where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to helping this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, when it's open, they already open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to <unk> them globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us to find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> is still in their place.
Please do it in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say, realism <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can think about, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photograph.
<unk> in which you will have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem <unk>
They're the details or <unk>
I <unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it did.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So you get the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is an image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of pictures of different places.
And so I think it's easier to create a place that you find it because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made red the house of the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes to planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at a time you're very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please switch on the lights.
<unk> more intensity, because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> <unk> technological <unk>
The answer is that if I get to draw on a normal curve that I say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you <unk> for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a curved curve, it would be too dumb, would look at a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as the last <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years leading orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't stay forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
And it <unk> one of two things.
Or it's going to be converted to a typical curve -- I know like this until they come up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we now would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask and ask myself, is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
Where new state is headed the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember, the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition that we can do.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer systems.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away away and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back about half a half and a half thousand years when the Earth was a large <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals were organized -- we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, I had a set of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet held a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials from the outside and the droplets grow grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets are not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you have a <unk> <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow be <unk> being better at the time of bringing together <unk> chemicals to bring together more chemicals and more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, physically chemistry, very simple, but things are <unk> interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned how to store information.
They learned to maintain information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what was to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, has exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is actually expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security people at the airport.
But I <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then there was another big step in which things became very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we have evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they could avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that they were in a way, they were together in it, and they set up a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> them together, whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community they were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities got so close to that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the whole recipe in the board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that are not acting alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscle of the brain, or so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began <unk> information.
And building very special structures that didn't make more to process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit out of the fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build these information structures enormously advanced the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting in emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated, we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now spent the same time at the same time that we have <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> video cassette tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than what we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the program <unk> to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story I would tell you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years old.
<unk> and so on, took less than a million years.
And <unk> like electronics, seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that puts its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my hands for my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without recent <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity, which would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor is in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from <unk> <unk>
You could just run these instructions at random, running all these programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be a few random sequences of instructions, so none of them did.
But fortunately, it was able to figure out two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they better did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest of them.
And now we need the best to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
So let's take two programs, that <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of product programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please do the <unk>
<unk> again.
And some mutations <unk>
And it tries again to try again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are <unk> absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark programs. strangers.
But do you get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of that they get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
I was once going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use these programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster -- I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment to analogous to the <unk> organisms.
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give me some of my fake <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope a lot of you heard about it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that I've been talking about.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three than 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to be <unk> to the first base, don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 car <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the United States Children's player in <unk> in a regular season.
Now I think this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
That's not working, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family physician is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting better.
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me ask you.
What do you think that you should be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a nurse <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And the truth of this is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them into the world, and I included myself included, with the mandate to be perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian projected studied up to a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> of nurses General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very <unk> I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, as possible, to all of it, because so I'm going to give it to the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I was applying to go to a cardiologist who was going to be attending to this patient.
And they report to the market <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I saw it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was given to me a heart failure.
In these conditions that heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood is going to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there is difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
And I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her to her house.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the market <unk>
I didn't have the phone and I didn't have what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I mean, maybe I didn't want to be a resident in constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home to her house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner voice that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was going to ask the nurse who <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe that he's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to me with complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'll be OK."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he took the high school, and the ambulance next with the ambulance people took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At the time I did something I did not do normally, normally, I did something I can't normally do.
It went home from the emergency room at home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was born from Mrs. <unk> lady before, but another one, he told me three words -- those three words that most emergency medical doctors are.
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are you remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By an hour of having arrived at his house, after I gave her high school, he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance people brought the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock to it.
I just just breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They took medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against every hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they <unk> what was happening.
And in ninth day, he let him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They are never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was amazed by this and experienced for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more made that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I'm talking about is that makes us feel really bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure to <unk> things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why sent it to your house?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose to choose <unk>
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, <unk> opened up and finally came out the sky, and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, would you stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was in the emergency department, in a hospital hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got to a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He gave him penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was heading at the door, she was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head <unk> my head asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had an potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from throat, but it can cause the top of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You <unk> antibiotics via <unk> and they recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought that I had a <unk> <unk>
I had an X-ray of kidneys -- but it turned out a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and I called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk> it.
I checked it up and found some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, I called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well fine.
But every single case, I <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't go to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I went back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg will have a hard time to look at her eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't, which you can't sleep and the ones I know; who have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies started attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you give up the medicine to the people who make errors, we will have a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical litigation and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first paper that I wrote to the Star article that I wrote for the Star article -- <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every day, where one of every 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection <unk> are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, <unk> <unk> for medical errors <unk>
The U.S. Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, it comes to <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with sorry to alcohol -- and suddenly, my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't raise their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals who are prone to error, well, you won't have anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And their students were <unk> down to the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> you can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human <unk> human knows human <unk> and they are not proud of their mistakes, but they try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people with not the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of it, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people, and the average amount of choice that says to pick a middle American -- it's about 70 to a day.
Not a long time ago, on research on a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are <unk> by these executives and the time they were going to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How does the way the way we deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems I want to talk to you today about the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
While I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your response is positive for <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very <unk> <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
It had been about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when they took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is a shelf for <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He gave me the <unk> buses that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
pathway.
They had <unk> different classes.
They put a post for <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put out there -- six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what if people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> 60 than when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I had only <unk> three percent came to buy <unk>
And they stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times as likely to buy <unk> if they found six times when they found 24.
Well, we will decide that we don't buy <unk> we're probably going to be <unk> we're probably good at <unk> <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices are affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this wasn't <unk>
Now the story of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we looked at the savings decisions for retirement for about a million Americans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> funding in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the death rate reached the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of options, more people will be used to avoid the actions or investment.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision that <unk> even when this goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in health.
They are more likely to pick up some less <unk> things they objectively they are going to go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to contrast and pick up that awesome <unk>
Today I want to take you with four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, less than today, less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be a increase in sales, we will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> removed removed from the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they gained <unk> in <unk> by two major <unk> and under cost.
You know that supermarkets, on average, give 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there are about 100,000 products.
But the biggest store in the world is <unk> and there is just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial sector, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> <unk> <unk> at Harvard <unk>
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
Those who are really willing to choose, they are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't do their <unk>
So this afternoon, before this session, before this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people this audience a holiday on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk>
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know, there was a little trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really hit hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
So for people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very much <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit card than when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive for them.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being used to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that we would show exactly how we <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that I would get the staff to think of the positive things that they would do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a <unk> <unk>
We saw the <unk> <unk> across the <unk> corridor, the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if just just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a <unk> decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that are offering each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order that makes the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go out of a few options, four <unk> in 56 colors, many options.
And what about <unk>
How much you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who go from a lot of options, <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same data number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the change box doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We get excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help handle <unk> or better for you, to use them on their business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful careful about our choices is we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years I was in the East Germany in Germany -- if you had a writing machine to write it must be <unk> in the government.
You had to register a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big maker and prints one page, that page will end up having some little yellow dots in every page that follow a pattern that makes it and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can bring together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, enormous amounts.
There are really many cases of the <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The American secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> not <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the <unk> <unk>
The second group of suicide <unk> that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate you to motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous has <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous -- that they do to protest and the last group are the national America, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from <unk> or, actually, it was.
<unk> the transition last fall because of a <unk>
I <unk> the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
I said, in a meeting with representatives of Dutch government representatives -- I asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people to cause the attack on <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how are people going to cause a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except for <unk> a foreign authority.
<unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the <unk> of the Egyptian secret in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had been sold by the Egyptian government to intercept large the communications of citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a case criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The Internet is <unk>
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this the obvious answer should be like, "Well, it seems to be bad, but actually I don't really affect because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's playing privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trust in our governments today in 2011, any right that we have to do today, will be forever.
We <unk> blindly in any future government, in an administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that should be worried about the next 50 years.
Here's where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows from my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the most South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
The people were dying that protect our community and livestock and livestock are also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community in my community, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because I even help lions see the <unk>
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart.  They came up the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions did not come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that he will turn on and shut the lights.
And this is a tiny light lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little box. I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> go outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never got a problem with the lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals on the lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also used for <unk> <unk>
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid on the <unk> <unk> cows from my father, and I used to see flying planes and said it would someday be inside one.
And today I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they were invented <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: I already <unk> it once, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to put it on every step that I have to call my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small kid, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would be spending all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed in a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from the colleague of my sister.
Which said, "When I did this, the five family members of the family will stop in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As long as I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms watching his face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine <unk> North Korea in North Korea in North Korea.
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> energy <unk> all around me was completely <unk> at night except by the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture from North Korea at night compared to the countries with the countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North Koreans to allow North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw body bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the famine years I was sent to China to live with <unk> <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being a <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural -- it might be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at <unk> in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though <unk> were eventually released after one harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to get out of the other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding jobs -- all of their world can take place in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity -- I've decided to drive up to South Korea to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a huge gap between North and South Africa.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with my pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, made a plan. I began to study for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea was <unk> some money I sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location from the <unk> location.
They had to stop immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in a way, over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked you all of all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese -- I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> and I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest spots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in the prison of the embassy of South Korea.
I went out and came between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that the stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to another two North Koreans and <unk>
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to get more and more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I came together in South Korea, in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or anything.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in touch with familiar with family still and send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help <unk> an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South degrees.
This is <unk> <unk> stores and fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the city planners come together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed to South L.A. as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> <unk>
Like <unk> million other Americans, living in a food desert. The L.A. Center, home of food places to get and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places are killed to get more people than food food than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the L.A.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I was amazed to see that happening.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house you see the <unk> effects, the current food system has in their <unk>
I see loads of wheels <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I got tired of driving around 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to turn it off.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to turn it off.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> and we started planting our food forest, trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables ...
What we do, we are a kind of paid group, made up of the gardeners of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city looked at me and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on in it?
A court order for planting food into a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he spoke with the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> and we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the U.S. <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk> land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plants.
Why the hell does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to the result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. I <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I farming my art.
As a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the backyard, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if they let them be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We're the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hungry, and this only <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> I don't temes people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God no, I'm not afraid you're going to be <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so it was so just for a moment.
So Green Green has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We had had about 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If the kids are growing <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and body, eat blind people what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're traveling. I see children of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and convert it into healthy <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets for farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Is it going to take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs, and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very happy road.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, that it rains so much.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt that we have to <unk>
And especially if you go on <unk> and these cars -- that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road <unk>
The solution to that is to do road <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all water water will flow down the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you won't get water on water again.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise in it, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the land <unk>
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> like I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> among stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they're going to be <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> wool of that to clean up, and we can cut down the <unk> of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> and steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take a look at what happened.
This is the exhibition that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried many samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway in which we had to do a <unk> to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of aging at samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> and then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can replicate this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using <unk> energy -- to actually increase the life of the road, and they can actually get a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before you can show you how the repair behaves like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember <unk> one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was coming. News of his little gray <unk>
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news generally <unk>
The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls to school.
For the next five years, I <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be outside of the outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could get them <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one would be suspect where you can <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every school once suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, was to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It went back two years ago, just to convert our home to girls and women and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his entire family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there was moments when I was very frustrated by our life and I was always scared and I couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can get it to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud of graduate school at <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him over the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's so <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite and even in front of an opposition <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
In less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way to her village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice noticed her if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've noticed in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who have <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
We would think that these changes didn't last last long, after the retirement of the U.S. <unk>
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were going to fight for them, that the <unk> see the future and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never become a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, carrying <unk> dignity and social justice.
They've shown a copy of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 people -- we were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved me, along with many other women, rebuild the civil society, <unk> a inclusive civil and just to democracy and <unk>
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the decline of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a unique <unk> I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and the peace of <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was successful.
Women won a National Congress <unk> in the first election in 52 years.
Yet, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day with the news of the killing of the American <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military <unk>
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights rapes in the prisoners and their lack of respect for law.
Our society, made up of a particular mindset, more <unk> and it has gone away from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today, at all of us today to replace our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't carry peace and stability and security for Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why are our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much as men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election, which only <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of feminine <unk> more than the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a feminine speech that not only <unk> but also put the mercy in practice, instead of <unk> <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to end peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that covers all the humanity of that men and women have been <unk>
And so, like the uterus -- covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of the existence.
This is how "My <unk> comes to us all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us would tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk about a <unk> question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence and the question I'm going to deal with is what everybody makes for the usual <unk> Why is it left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no longer in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York my first job as a writer and an editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I believed my alma mater, <unk> me on his head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, he put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working on the <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and "The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years old married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, all religions, all religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place in the families, the last place that we would want or hope to find <unk> which is why, abuse, domestic abuse.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who hits it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands are killed in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic abuse, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and began to <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had some big <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> <unk> and seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We began to go out and loved all of me, which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, which I had passion to help teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, as a writer, as he had ever done before.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I had left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> that was entering the head of a physical and financial trap carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts her.
And this is where those <unk> are coming in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe and I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one is under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns out of the trauma that lived in a small body.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never set up my hand, my life already was serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning and I still have <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put into my mother's suit and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy for always, because I loved her, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and for the fact that we form a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident and I never would do harm.
I spent twice as much in our moon.
I was the first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so strong in the head that he <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our <unk> moon <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we were the victims, we know something that normally you are <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the violence in the cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family justice system to <unk> the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> his mother.
And we still continue to ask why it's not <unk>
I was able to go away, because of one last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed him if he would have killed her.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world -- to the police, the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are they <unk>
For some people this is a way to say blame is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> intentionally intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them, and they would embrace their lives and joyful lives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of a very typical domestic violence.
I went to marrying a <unk> man and kind of <unk> and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do not go back to have never more, ever is a gun charged with my head of someone who says they want.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, their sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence just shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
I was using the abuse of the light by talking about it with their children, their <unk> their jobs and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as people have fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence for intervening consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress that like this.  Luckily, I brought my clothes to <unk>
This is the first change in clothing on a <unk> <unk> so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them back now, but you figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater through your head, because it's when they're going to make fun of me, so they don't do anything in the head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
And the photographer was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I <unk> the back of the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always say, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and you might be wondering what is this inheritance.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to take advantage of making money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so many models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> <unk> -- that is less than four percent, not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when they <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what I would actually tell you to every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> of American American magazine, or the executive CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you have to make a model is like to say you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to be able to get your studies, and you have a copy of them and a lot of jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to say, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you have to take your <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I wore my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures of French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and at <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people from <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I have never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I was given for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stepped into a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a piece of sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, because of my way, I don't know what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what it looks no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them -- it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I <unk> <unk>
When I do research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure takes to the 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit <unk> and you have the most brilliant hair and you're going to be very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to work with creative people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my day every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brightest and <unk> hair, but probably the women are physically <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender as I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope you're all more comfortable with the power of the image in the sense that we have the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't get me who <unk>
There was no <unk> directors, no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even very much very careful in lighting.
In fact, most of the <unk> they were random.
My story begins when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
So it happened to go back to New York just one year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> trip and you continue the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to go through the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a October week -- to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter <unk> new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how he feels and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking around, and we were stopped on a dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the sandwich store that <unk> <unk> in previous <unk>
And he described what had felt at age five years in that same place.
He pointed out that reminded her heart of <unk> heart when you see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and not <unk> in getting to somebody and ask him, get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and <unk> and applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   So my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> World <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are you <unk> very important -- first of all, they provide vital services, <unk> <unk>
It's our <unk>
<unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They actually help absorb the anthrax that they would not be for them would spread out and have great loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> it was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, a few very important <unk> <unk> in places like Eastern Tibet, is nowhere to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical danger list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey to the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a stance.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge <unk> time for <unk> the number of cases of anger has grown enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so to focus on a <unk> problem is not going to be anything.
We have to work with governments on the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about seeing the <unk> about the need of appreciating these wonderful creatures and the services that they get.
How can you help? It can become assets, you can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw it fly without effort, without the skies cost in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica of <unk> <unk> and Somalia. With technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, which Italians were good at, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that <unk> <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia.
So we came up with seeds -- <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were <unk> to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were quite amazed  we were quite amazed that the local in such fertile <unk> had not been agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't hear anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> in time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe that, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red <unk> at night -- about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, so we have no agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we were just the Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the writers did, what the English ones were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people of Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> and we treat people just about two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to take any of a different culture as if you were my children, I want to get <unk>
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if I was my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, <unk> small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
It should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman he opened this conference, put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just answer the people just to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start to do anything, you have ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local passion, who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with people of <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a cafe. We came together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important <unk>
And so we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once you get to a community to tell people what to do, why do not, for once, do they <unk> but not in meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been <unk>
So planning has this blind <unk>
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work on one, and we work on the face -- you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business of the business -- that it sets up with you in your house, at the table of her kitchen table in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform her passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia as well.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this <unk> junk where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How do you do that?" And I said, "I did something really, really, really, really difficult.
I <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business managers, business advisers passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> said, "The planning is really incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now we have a <unk> rebuilding without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk with you.
You have to offer you for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you have to get in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people -- the intelligence and <unk>
What do you talk about you have been doing this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- we have not <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year we came up with this group of people -- and I <unk> what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure has produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years in 1900, in the United States were <unk> generic companies, generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In other ways, they will not come up with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute dedicated <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic administration and you have to have a great financial administration.
Guess what?
Never have met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not yet born.
We have looked at the 100 shell companies, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of <unk> business in <unk> along with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this <unk> who is going to ask you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can search for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> you look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't switch on a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much people pay for their neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask <unk> more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes to the cows for our communities so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds <unk> with the giant <unk> giant <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always <unk> the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of American properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought I could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this occurred to me a profound gratitude for the time and lived in this way.
It gave him clarity to the significant things about my life today.
But I would encourage you to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up by day and forgetting the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends made the wall of this house house on a giant board and he painted on a giant board and he painted on her phrases <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before they die I want to be <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
"Before they die I want to sing for millions of people."
<unk> I want to plant a <unk>
<unk> I want to live outside of the <unk>
"Before I die I want to <unk> once more."
<unk> I want to go to the <unk>
<unk> I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me solace in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about shaping the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit kit and now they've been made across countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, it is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
Death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we have more power.
And if you think about death -- it will save our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hopes with hopes and fears of people around us, not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and <unk>
And not speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's <unk> <unk> happens.
It's not <unk> They don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice this never <unk>
When I singing songs from our childhood, I try to say words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, <unk> conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would have to pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the notion of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it doesn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk>
Now, for those fewer familiar familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests <unk> that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development of the development that is faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived in and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking out the washing machine and eat anything that was in the <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that gives us differences and fact that it doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you might have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inside, and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate <unk> of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we are trying to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what should have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, who would give a kind of communication to students from engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with their great minds, their great books and their large unknown words.
But as we develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt when I had these conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to the environment and health care among others, and if we don't know we don't understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and sexy is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't tell us that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a hurdle for our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is a lot more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make silly ones.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways to stick with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they're called <unk>  What do we do the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a bit, and then you provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other we open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor for the 19th century, which defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that for a public charge no matter -- no matter -- or a <unk> platform, and that, when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
One thing I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the <unk> camera.
And this was all because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him in the <unk> Tower, but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end it had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first <unk> use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. People in the U.S.
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
They read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if he did it or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the most <unk> title -- more <unk> and more <unk> than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously with a title as ridiculous and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to go there, waiting the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says a measurement is <unk>  <unk> that we're going to stay waiting for years more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and this is that President of the President of America does not sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads <unk> the world's biggest economy and a fleet of raw vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So I finally won the <unk>
They got his title <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, I was a <unk>
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate and the Senate of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I think that I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the fact that the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 meters underground in a illegal mine.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about, but above all, that cacophony of male and <unk> stones and rocks with primitive.
As a <unk> I wear a cheap firefly <unk> attached to my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> <unk> the walls of that <unk> hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
I <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met before, who lost the control and fell <unk> meters in that toilet.
While I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole in the order of their lives in their lives without paying or reward and, often, dying.
I went home and went home but they may never will, because they're <unk> from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who was going to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not in such a degree.
When we finished talking to me I was very wrong, I honestly was going to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
And so I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, there was a lot of these places.
Some of you would even consider them my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire <unk> slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk>
However, you can produce entire families for <unk> debt from 18 18 dollars.
<unk> slavery generates profit from more than 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work for them to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves they have value, but those those are <unk>
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet, it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> <unk>
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees men, men, women, children, in fact, families were blown away in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads up to the time, and put them out of <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it just a little bit <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot and <unk> and let me work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was just on my side, very quickly grabbed me, and he said, <unk> I won't do this here."
And he explained to me so clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
It could put them in a worse situation that they were already <unk>
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system by his release and trusted that he <unk>
As to me, I waited home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles through <unk> terrain until trucks that they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who load them and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something that <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all the whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had entirely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I was advised to be hard to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
And they took me out of the <unk> <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local to force <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to <unk> the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number <unk> on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
<unk> often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From foot in the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> fear, and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no big enough windows to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, if you touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of blue and his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and put silk on the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me about stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay your job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the world's greatest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers -- some of the younger kids.
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and they forced to work extensive in these boats into the lake, even though they didn't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> which his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, and <unk> and <unk> are thrown into water to release the branches.
Many <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to <unk> young slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
<unk> and <unk>
And I would argue that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village for fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partnerships with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike. He suddenly had a sudden and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to go through it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up on their back, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his <unk> eyes, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to 90 feet and these people have got heavy heavy stone bags that are then going to be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
You know, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look more closely at the side of the side, we see the way to work at other <unk> and also children.
They're all the victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this <unk> victim and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who was being forced into the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines and 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has dreams of being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a face of remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to provide witness to them, and we will do everything that we could to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> They're people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day I happen to happen that I don't think of these many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images wake up a force where you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire and that that fire <unk> on slavery on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there is a particular problem for whom <unk> are like management team.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I want to try and explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were telling us the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill, and probably some initial demonstrated that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease distribute this extraordinary ability that extraordinary ability to do it with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a chronic ballet dancer <unk>
In the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement movement is not biological <unk> so they don't serve blood delivery and best that we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside clinical trials, they never do have never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the test <unk>
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to do is I want to describe it as a <unk> way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it emits sounds at speak, and we can imagine, as dancers of a vocal dancer because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are <unk> for example.
And as they did it requires a remarkable training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
And from sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and so like Parkinson's -- it affects <unk> it also affects <unk> organs.
On <unk> you can see an example of the shake <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these scores based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of these are <unk> right, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they have about 30 seconds for a lot.
They're very low cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something becomes so <unk> it comes into mass scale.
These are some goals that are amazing to address.
We can reduce the patient's hard difficulties in patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> could be able to get goals.
We could make a massive mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative, <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> can call low price and leaving for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to tell you whether you have or not the disease.
<unk> you see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers for the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on mobile phone network, which is what we <unk> the project. We now have another percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in no windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin in the perfect skin we do the impossible, we could be able to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the image and the photograph.
On March 11 of 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happened in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- <unk> <unk> -- was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen in <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded it reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers of land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
It <unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
They were schools, and we took the sludge out, and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors just found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and punch cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places in the villages of around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that these pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As you were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms -- the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day they were <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond myself my horizons something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't help but think of as <unk> how to fix that <unk> and to repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the <unk> photo.
With the step of time, they came to the more pictures and they got more <unk> so this is that I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people to join <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were to <unk> a village neighbor north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the <unk> <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time you <unk> in <unk> it's a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could have an hour. I could make a few weeks.
It could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw in almost hand using a guide areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> <unk> covered with bacteria, and even with oil, all of this along with the step of time and continue to <unk> so much hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more pictures already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to the photos.
I had begun to <unk> she himself but stopped when he noticed the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not be <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures shared something about their history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble far away from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk> it.
Day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their children small, not as small as their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave him his photographs her son at the youngest 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift he could <unk> something that he could look at, something that he could remember from the past that wouldn't have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up with more <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority returned to their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families with totally <unk> and <unk> pictures.
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, somebody liked it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to us, but the first thing we would need to look for.
This was what the project was about to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected to some of them bigger with something bigger to give back, using their talent to something that are not very thin <unk>
To end up I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering about a baby, <unk> me because a little bit like my family -- my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of technique -- <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create video motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on and switch it into a second <unk> or a second <unk> to create a <unk> package of photons just a millimeter pack.
And that pile of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do they keep those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all this --   remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is that it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounce inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the <unk> of the top you see on the background of the bottle, after a number of boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and <unk> and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A week?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow movement.
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> on the table, the tomato and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I think, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of this.
But if you look at more and more <unk> they will notice that, as the lights were <unk> of the <unk> it is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light goes into it, and it goes back out of various <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at Act at MIT?
Like photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> picture, it enters very little light.
But we will go to a billion times faster than the shortest show than I can barely get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You walk into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get these multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast -- our <unk> has unique capability.
It's really good time resolution. And it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point that corresponds to which distance.
So when a laser project you can record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like that, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what is at the back of the curve,
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking at the inside of the body by <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood of this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> <unk> to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> he turned science into art, an art of <unk> photographs.
I realized that all of the <unk> of data that we collected every time is not just for scientific <unk> but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computational photograph with a very slow motion and color code.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events occur in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
It <unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone, a <unk> against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a protest and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, move it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were going to take a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who of <unk> have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Blackberry, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Most of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my mobile, and what changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police from Eastern <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone, <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who would give me all the information they had on me.
I asked them once, and I came back to ask me, and I didn't get a particular answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not giving you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
I demand demand and they would send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court ruled the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly person on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 percent of information.
I looked at the beginning and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a two-year <unk> of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and go ahead.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate. I know what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who gives you an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this never happened.
The Berlin Wall of Berlin may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and businesses want to store so much information from us as possible in the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to do it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just about fashion.
When you go home to go home to your representative that just because the state agencies are able to store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information <unk>
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor he brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so it will spread all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it's not <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, though they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in this room.
It's wrong for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be a disabled thing.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> Christmas Day, they are in the mall, they drive in circles in a parking lot and what see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> <unk> woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system and <unk> that I was also going, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all of the top note -- all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five, putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang out a dollar in front of me so that we would get it.
The <unk> I carry in was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day at the kindergarten day I walked like a <unk> <unk> who had a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and still being the family.  I think no one realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot of a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live in three months without eat, so <unk> of dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, at <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing <unk> as well.
And when my friends were going through summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to get me warm <unk> on my back, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I thought, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's really boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up for <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the Arizona, which was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet of the theater.
Everybody <unk>
I did all the same tasks of the least <unk> I took out the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl in cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, and ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunt stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave an actor without a cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disabled <unk>
I graduated home, and my first tour tour, was like extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> actors, <unk> with disability.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took <unk> <unk> in New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell into the account that he was at high speed on New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little little sound that says that women are not fun, and they find it really fun.
In 2003, my family of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival New York City, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media and to remind you to remind the <unk> principals that <unk> and Arab are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news program by wire behind with Keith <unk>
I walked as if I went to a college <unk> I would take a study and sat me on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed on the desk of the <unk> not going out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like I was going to get full-time and pasted my chair.
Something that I learned in direct Keith with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never had a little girl and a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I <unk> online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
"What does it mean?
We should really be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media media, I don't think <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We still need to use every society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the whole great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> a charity for refugee children to be Palestinians -- the tiniest fraction of what my parents <unk> me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
The <unk> drives the other people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything in there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital in Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there's no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year later, nothing.
One day he gives him a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money so that they bought new clothes, money to send your family home.
I presented to a young man.
She finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a car bomb.
That young boy in that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization on al Qaeda.
So, how the story of a young people in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for a chance to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story repeats itself into urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, for jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they are not giving them any opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door to terrorism to violence, the violence will be the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
Seventy percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do not almost anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of this hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some young leaders at a corporate <unk>
<unk> to some 90 junior leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate graduate university university -- frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war has completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It started <unk> motorcycle residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point, to expand hundreds of bikes over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I believe that corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so helpful.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were to plastic from abroad.
If you give someone, you "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, who could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit that is really a big step, but young people need capital to do their reality.
They need experience and guidance to <unk> in the development and put their business on.
<unk> young people with the resources they need to support the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> <unk> this is how it's called, when it is created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young men are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young in entrepreneurs, <unk> and feeding their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the <unk> <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going on the way that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I discovered something terrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet -- <unk> <unk> <unk> aluminum balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to take out what they had <unk> who thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who clean our crap in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> -- the <unk> of <unk> -- the reason of 11 tons of waste and <unk> tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What is it like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking on the weight of their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> it's one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that are often left with the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about how relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always because it's moving.
And the stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor labor on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the form of efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> its dangers and its dangers inherent to be very real ways.
But we had run that for decades, and centuries they come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have room for what the economy of the economy begin to fail when you're in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed back to it.
And then it's what I call our average speed of everyday <unk>
I mean by that just at the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We don't usually <unk> us or <unk> we didn't clean up and we take our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, we <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that you take out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe will help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us with us, our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of vegetable <unk> on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the <unk> and there was a man doing his <unk> journey as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that I began to investigate waste <unk> and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together many times and made us good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species should include and to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste -- what we think about when we're talking about trash, they represent three percent of the entire nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of her days and their lives, the next to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects here as an example of this.
Both of projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining skins generates heat inside, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted to the old market that is this structure of the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to studying the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth growth -- where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, linking all the inputs in the building.
And this extends into a <unk> atrium, that creates a space in the open air in the building that <unk> through its own shape and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also of light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, which helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that let the air go through the air and light in a way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to light up the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall. It wasn't what he <unk>
But finally we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall because there was more local people to sell.
And the idea of the facade was far cheaper -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this inner <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and collect water for the <unk>
You wait for the beginning of the next year, because we're on the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project that's so big, the biggest I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access to connected access to almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets and in creating 12 early blocks that are similar and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell cell, as the <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that ensures that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up higher density at the upper levels and lower density in the lower plant.
And it also <unk> this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the space that's busy construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can climb and <unk> and make such activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives, changes local communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came to our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair, and a little <unk> little <unk> of cute <unk> was super strong for <unk> <unk> very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a day after the <unk> of school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took on the table of my teacher on grades.
And then I did.
I <unk> on the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the way --  And I set up to give back the book in <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself and myself a row -- just to be there, because I <unk>
I'm still amazed by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I would never tell me.
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little girl that was so small, it was so good at <unk>
I mean jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration of the sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where you study the <unk> in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no shading that if there were no shading that if there was no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no <unk> king and <unk> and a <unk>
They wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I was looking at my high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost that has all of them.
This year two years of his masterpiece, in pursuit of the time I was going to get the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced to the person, their wish, their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when they feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in storytellers storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details that are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> make all of <unk> novelists and that is something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool <unk> that <unk> it on his lover, he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion that we have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> I like these bright and bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of sudden listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- so defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for the truth, of truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> the more painful truth the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to suffer, to us causes a much more profound range of feelings and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this way that way.
Is there any other excitement about us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look with intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was being used to be consumed with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud says there was a strange thing on that man, who is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> make us look at <unk> but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we became the <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years old was captured by creating a fake account on Facebook from which they would send horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange, brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to how to express our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm, and the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> their most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to get what you have to take away from your <unk> and <unk> what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you have your <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road to Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as well as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good at the citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a few <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> in each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, <unk> problem.
You know, in a minute <unk> there's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get it from the greatness of another.
We can relate to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction, <unk> jealousy.
fiction used to the <unk> invites the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization in American history.
To get to the Moon, NASA took over a billion dollars from today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked by 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo <unk> program 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of whom I knew after <unk> death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that they were because the Kennedy president wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> people ask why <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why would you fly over the <unk>
Why do I play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the technology of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and was removed the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> boat -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew 40,000 miles -- / <unk>
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo <unk> 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that problems we would solve the technology solve how we go to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a <unk> result.
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they don't get to the <unk> <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that <unk> it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> us and have enriched <unk> with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years where they are <unk> <unk> Microsoft, <unk> and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that the venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused us to <unk> the creation of <unk> ideas for <unk> problems or even fake problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small, <unk> investment that they could leave in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need huge capital and whose development is long-term in the long term. We also have never invested in the development of technologies because they don't have a commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons why we can't solve large problems are more complicated and profound problems.
Sometimes we choose to don't solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that is popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption came from sources of renewable energy as solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can actually compete on price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what political and treated international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development and some kind of carbon <unk>
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties on that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked technological, they are not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are the result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, some resistant <unk> to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need to have it, but these four elements are going to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it must really be a problem of <unk> and we should understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve large problems, it serves with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no mythology of science science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a big decline of trust, it's a very general <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First, the <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions and the institutions that might have risen in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to <unk> polls and <unk> polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's not a lot of evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political <unk> follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the record survey polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is <unk> attitudes, that people manifests themselves when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody would say, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> to ask, "What do I do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust a few other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel like a kind of a <unk> <unk> or a person's person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust an elementary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not reliable.
And I think those people who would <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, so that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to do a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we're going to have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I see their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If so, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're trying to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, <unk> officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we find that the <unk> system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
Now you all know about similar examples.
They put all that out of the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that are reliable and if we were trying to determine whether other people, officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> on the task -- rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is <unk> because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't fully <unk> all the people all the time.
But you also have to bring some <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes every day, everywhere, it makes people common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks is that I can do it with no matter of progress.
I carry them and give me the money, or I would change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worth of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how <unk>
So I first created this tool that gets steps into digital space, so that when you get the strong <unk> against the screen it transfers his physical body to pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas straight in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands still remain on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and points out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that's below every floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned to things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make it a physical way that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like that?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel alone.
This imam <unk> behaves like a pixel in 3D space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control through the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach physically <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets like the movement, the physics, and, unlike the monitors books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> ourselves from our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineering, like them.
Then after surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only an effective path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if the work would like me or work.
But my dream was to be an opera in Chinese opera,
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was already too much to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I think for the rest of my life -- a second class of second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> tries to live Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading habit of <unk>
It <unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning this map was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to work on research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offer academics a deeper understanding of it.
And I thought that comparative literature worked on research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two to two.
They can be from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like feeling or <unk>
Having a dream have broken really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that <unk> is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
And Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> grabbed on the couch of my office and took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like a <unk>
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy to just move the head as they hit the solution.
<unk> are the <unk> new <unk> I was saying Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later, you have children later, you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had a long time.
But a little bit later, my <unk> <unk> to push her to Alex that I'd talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under the category <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yeah, people sit after what they were <unk> but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> <unk>
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one is going to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes!
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> you take a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
That means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life that you will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People of the more 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that over half of the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future couple at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means if there's something you want to change from themselves, now is the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than anywhere else in life, and we know that the female fertility goes to its top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to <unk> over their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its daily and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in an adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists <unk> names <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that for great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, who is really interesting as you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was staying in stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the <unk> and so many of us start a career, pick a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful doing everything once <unk>
The middle-aged age crisis is not about buying a red sporting <unk>
It's about realizing that you can't have your career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, <unk> so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a few <unk> very hard -- his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often <unk> in our <unk> but then they woke up her same as she says, "One doesn't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if you give me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to be able to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like to only sit while the decade <unk> of Emma was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that would be <unk> from that identity of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> identity makes identity capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that we should not count, which by the way, is not exploration, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and do it.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who get together with friends with similar minds are limited limited to who you know what you know what they know about, how they talk about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out of it almost always comes from their nearest circle.
The new things come from what you call weak ties.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs were created never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a <unk> work.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last, but not least, Emma believed you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when they have a couple and a couple of their family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the <unk> is better to sit down than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live in now or <unk> you now now start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with whoever is that <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went through that <unk> and she found the roommate from a cousin who worked at a museum art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a work there.
That offer of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend alive.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> events in museums.
This married man who chose a <unk>
She loves his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to me that said, "Now the emergency room room are not enough, <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West <unk>
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at age or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the following generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity capital -- use their weak ties.
They don't know what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> in New York schools in New York.
And like any professor, I took test and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I was working it was, <unk> grades.
What struck me is that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing they need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After a number of years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods -- really hard to figure out what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results.
We partnered with private companies, asking them what these marketers are going to hold work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, emerged a trait like an important success of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just a week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my <unk> <unk> and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when they put them into every feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of testing tests -- even the security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little people know about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I change your <unk>
What should I do to teach children a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent does not give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are lots of individuals who are just not following their <unk>
In fact, in our data, human determination is not related to or is even related to inversely <unk>
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing technology is something called <unk> of <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have at the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to encourage you to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
I <unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But to a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that whoever is that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning that might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw every single character of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was yelling at a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This is actually <unk> in the form of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way. The people will work.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this is so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
Walk a mouth over the tree, that is a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a <unk> tree is pretty <unk>
Remember the <unk>
Two fireworks, it gets very hot.
Three up together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Walk the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes over the <unk> horizon.
A door. Get a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> <unk> is someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> are <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same thing as a Chinese Chinese learns as well.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun comes next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> to their political enemies to their political enemies over the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and <unk>
What I rather like to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician magician together.
The film was <unk> his imagination for a months.
His favorite favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a bright wand and carrying a magic wand on it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex of child show.
However, <unk> magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to the rise of years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dress as guard from the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one thing about the <unk> magician is that the most <unk> <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see Star Wars and my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So he was <unk> in the room and was impressed like a mom standing with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
I <unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How does it win to Dorothy your movie?
We're doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world where I want my children to grow <unk> Okay? And not a world of men who <unk> that is where we are.
Why is there as much <unk> capital force in movies for our children, and so little on the <unk> path of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give up the proper framework that I would have served to navigate around the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected the credits to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and defending the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, kids are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how they fight the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to fight the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continues on in classic after generation. Every one of them on the adventures of a child, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, it was finally <unk>
I recommend all of you, it's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I'd had with a friend of the film that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there are more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid who are so much like that?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women have and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good <unk> movie <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a movie of Hollywood <unk>
<unk> does not happen <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it a lot of the movie happens in a embassy embassy where men and women were hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door, and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it into the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular movies -- how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said:
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What can't they get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of male hero is to defeat the <unk> of violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that it looks after home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star <unk> favorite <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to encourage them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to have a lot of stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and the struggle and more stories where it looked like their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the <unk> magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was most like was looking for <unk> <unk> on the coast of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would give you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became an passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up at about 1.3 miles tall, along with the <unk>
And my <unk> had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the east east of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians activities.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it measures roughly <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> landscape in a <unk> landscape.
And swimming in the same random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this kind of slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample DNA <unk> but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
That means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> work, quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> workshop there.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones used in the <unk> of the Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle <unk> in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite <unk> shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find it <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Empire -- probably was written in <unk> years ago, <unk> years ago.
So share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to you, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
As ideas really were started in 1984 B.C. in a missing city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a bike bike race and go in direction to their entry door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, wheels that go on their side, lightning from the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
The <unk> to the hallway or what I have on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I talk about.
They can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're going to go to the mouth in the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing and dancing <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now I went to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow and yellow bricks from the oven they come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I suppose, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they were looking at them once.
I <unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I set up poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who she could memorize the order of a deck of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a <unk>
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition they say they have normal memory.
"We have trained ourselves to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques that invented invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and the <unk> <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "What is it that I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English, but a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And back back, I gave him a set of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory -- it wasn't a little bit as rare as you can seem like it today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that we have become a cognitive <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- it's this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is a skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a bunch of researchers from University College in London invited a group champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: it has brains in some way, structural brains wanted to know.
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than <unk>
They gave the cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference in yet a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI machine, <unk> their brains as <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of snow found that in the memory champions of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race in where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize them in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates that with a elegant paradox as the <unk> paradox: <unk> says this: I mean two people who remember the same word, I say to you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word that I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who told her that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name is <unk> it doesn't actually mean anything to you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They get good enough when they go back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
He had hired him as a entertainment, because earlier, if you wanted to give a very good party, you wouldn't bring it to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon he was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies that were <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> <unk> standing in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
He took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or the phone numbers or instructions that are word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual space and exceptional space.
If you were to tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet that if you let them tell you who you were sitting on the horse <unk> <unk> in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and images with images with the things that you want to remember.  The <unk> idea, <unk> <unk> and <unk> the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you guys have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory in the same way that would have done it -- if you had done it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And you can come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy image and crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering their house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that weird journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> not word for word, which is going to be <unk> <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> <unk>
Seriously, is like seeing a lot of people sitting up taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a lot of fun.
I would never have waited for it to do.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is really about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard standard equipment for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a few safety <unk> covered with tape <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve good <unk> for my entire research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute power to <unk> <unk> and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. <unk> who work work.
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be built <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
It <unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of profound processing, a complete kind of attention that most of you are not going to go out there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I had to leave you with today is what I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to work in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities at all of us.
But if you want to live a life -- you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, and so I would take it just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm in <unk> <unk> I was six years ago, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, since my bedroom, was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that gave the living room.
And there was all the time spent watching TV -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody got me, and every time I got down and I would come back and come back into a towel -- everybody was looking at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
I <unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> division of areas, but of those connections.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans pass 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
And architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about it, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as well as based on a building half a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, stable, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, red brick -- which leaves what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the <unk> values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, the so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On the side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms of life.
We were going to do it and we kind of <unk> ourselves from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel really good, but we're dead because we have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experience <unk> we do swing the <unk> to go ahead and over and over and over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with something called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That is a guess.
<unk> small, large-scale scale.
Something really hard.
So we get closer to the 1980s, and we started embracing those symbols.
<unk> the self in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add <unk> and we use a new materials.
They love them.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we converted them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> facts.
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
madness.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers and moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
You may have a little bit of <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
<unk> feel frustrated and we started making a swing one again in the other direction.
In the early '80s, in the early '90s, we started experimenting with something called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now have new design techniques of computer design, and we find new <unk> a few ways that are attached to other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and public <unk> were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao went into two 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Frank was everywhere.
He was our first architect.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
They did the top mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon in the early millennium, country with other architects.
They went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to spend with all the architecture.
Think about it, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't get a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 percent more buildings, before we know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the self to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until we get in both extremes almost in <unk> and <unk> actually the difference between innovation and <unk> among us, architects and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked exactly at the time, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started coming up and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a communication, because these are not just images of a communication, because these are not just images of a building, that's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by changing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building had been today, first <unk> on the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experiment.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures who use words that use <unk> and <unk> <unk> and one is no longer a <unk> audience, who doesn't embrace anything that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you are not leaving the architecture.
That means the pendulum <unk> one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> of red brick with the ideas of what a <unk>
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the contrary.
This means that a parking garage in Miami in Miami can also serve to do a sports or a <unk> or even you can get married at night.
That means that three architects can dream with swimming on the New York Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars from the <unk> community around that cause, no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to see.
Because no longer matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more intelligent and more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the more <unk> in local libraries the local libraries of the households where our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just had a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives themselves these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, When do I do do this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, he's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time he was beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
And the one that his mom tells him and what his mom or school friends say, you don't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal woman, normal <unk> who receives these answers in one of the most emotionally physically vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that's never been up.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures coming in hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of people who have had and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what authentic and what is <unk>
What is the highlight of someone else's life in front of what normal is in a whole context every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> follow our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the kind of <unk> stars of sports, and folk singers.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to hurt.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how we taxpayers society and the business development camp.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> engaging in the <unk> classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One of five are not coming at classes at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see good enough if you don't think you're good enough -- <unk> a lower note on the average of your fellow who you don't care about it about appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So to be pretty clear, we're talking about how you see you not about how you see it.
<unk> over your body is <unk> the academic <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> <unk> less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, involved in healthier diet than they can take them to a food disorder,
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this for what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic, aesthetic relationships, and without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pulling into the health system and our government costs it billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're <unk> again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is about interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there's a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not just going to have a positive impact, but also an <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are central points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental education, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of the current status of women are seen, and I talked in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of the Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as you see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we posted in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you what was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, and as governments and as businesses, to change our culture, so our children will grow valuing their entire person, to be valuing their own <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It will make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see you see that they are never the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two seats out of the woman -- what would it mean for her if she was liberated from that <unk> voice, in his interior, that he would <unk> you for not having long legs, <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to take this and give her potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is attached to us.
But let our children do the truth.
<unk> the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
I put the self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and comparing us to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they become agents of safe change from themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the top November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense League <unk>
At <unk> they were initially innocent -- but I was prisoner by other clinical charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of <unk> <unk> including <unk> <unk> and the United <unk>
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, an elementary school, a primary school teacher did everything possible for giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
As I experience I saw that when people take time to interact you don't need a lot to get to wish the same stuff in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there's always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think about to use all the possible media so that they all lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he was explained to me that in the last few friends, he had been working on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> that without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained to me how to point in the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise all of us, especially me, all the objective broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and Arab said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, such a child.
All of us, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and beat other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody who was now a moment of packing and go to another city.
As I was always the new side of the class there is often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but will be the new one of the silent class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time spent home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I have been <unk> to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that we put to test my thinking was, was during the year of 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days to come out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and quite frankly, I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done to believe me that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people all of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and for extension, all the gay women were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical and less critical than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind of exactly the way I want to be treated.
So that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to preserve my heart forever while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of somebody who has had enough <unk> with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside the inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why would I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, some day, who is going to try to take your story to the violence and understand that there's a better way. Which even though I get to me with this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism victims, against those acts of ways, such as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that projects happen in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that we project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing that we would do more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you're conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for a living.
If we don't know -- nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need to get together to produce no longer experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I <unk> that vision.
The psychology is studying behavioral behavior -- neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a blooming of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of work on the fantastic work that I launched Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy, or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness to the questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they do with the brain <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, don't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how <unk> work <unk> how <unk> are adapting and <unk> living living -- all these things are questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we play <unk> how we play <unk> all kinds of behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end of the conclusion I came to the conclusion that that was not working for reasons.
And I think we get stuck at this point.
We have a wonderful explanations chain, we get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry account for biology, biology accounts part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to move that idea to our scientific worldview.
I think that consciousness, right now, it's sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at <unk> <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain, the behaviors of the brain, and so they study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that vision is quite close to simply that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as a building <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they think of fundamental principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, <unk> law, <unk> law, and I applied the basic <unk> as a fundamental concept that those <unk> <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- that space time, time, <unk> <unk> then <unk> then <unk> then you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a primal brick of nature.
It doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, right?
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is we need to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with other concepts exploring space, time, the time, mass processes process.
<unk> sometimes tell us that we want fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws of laws so simple that we can get them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans -- dogs dogs, by flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> some common precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anybody think that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that, although the idea seems to be a lot less for different cultures for different cultures -- where the human mind looks more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process -- is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever you have information processing, and there's awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, as in a human being, awareness.
<unk> simple information, <unk>
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed this kind of <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And it is supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a different degree of information, as well as a kind of significant <unk> significantly important <unk>
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is tiny, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually gives you a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking's mentioned, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts him in the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This view, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have a really serious ethical and ethical and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had not to eat anything that had become, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision to be <unk>
I think about thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system on the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they present serious ethical problems about the ethics of smart computers systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of our collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective consciousness, an internal <unk> an internal film for this whole bunch of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer by the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental idea, that the second is a fundamental thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile. <unk> in education.
I went to school, I <unk> with my friends, I <unk> with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a community prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a secret problem.
She didn't actually get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, he had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing I can consider as a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 studies -- a boy raised his hand, and he said, "Hey, when you go to your <unk>
I said, "What did you do?"
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in <unk> they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this chair of wheels, and you're probably waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to disability.
Yes, you've been sold the lie that disability is something called a <unk> a capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability you make you fantastic you <unk>
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we have been able to spread even more than a lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with a little bit of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we <unk> the adults in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we could see them and think, "Well, for very bad my life, it might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the question of the number of times that have been <unk> <unk> to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was standing up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
And so there are some things.
But the things that we overcome is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
I need the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because they've been sold this lie that disability has been exceptional to us.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by any time inspired by any time <unk>
And I actually know I'm there.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery of the mobile phone battery in your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is bad <unk> the reason that that's a lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a <unk> have never done it to become a <unk>
Never.
Nor are a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be able to get them out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the <unk> achievement of disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a <unk> kid in a high school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and the professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality augmented our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of play by 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, <unk> trying to <unk> with all of them.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I put some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the canoe and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine moving up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that there are people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> at the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice. mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
<unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many already knows about.
The <unk> Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my <unk> Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network? or you would have a <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will their experience be when they come from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to their field <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put the radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to his group, and you see his next move shown in front of you, in a plastic display that you wear <unk> you don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
or they memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera on each corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> which is already working on.
And all that information is you send your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have information <unk>
This is going to get the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they are the <unk>
They <unk> the ball and <unk>
You take an open <unk> Suddenly a <unk> on the left part of your display -- you will tell you that an defense behind you is going to be <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the <unk> system will <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in their bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The audience <unk> and fans have continued to move it from each of an angle.
This is something to create massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show somebody how it is, literally, be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much of this technology is worth trying to show you how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay woman in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be <unk>
What is also also for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the <unk> far south of <unk> County, which includes the Golden <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to <unk> by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden <unk> bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> <unk> a superintendent head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk> or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will bring them over to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it has taken you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that are under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most dying of impact.
The ones that not, they normally <unk> in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that those who are going to take this suicide method of suicide <unk> the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that day we succeeded in bring it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've gone a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train to the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met it at 22 <unk> last year when he was getting a call from a possible <unk> subject on the shelf near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an <unk> officer.
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, my family son called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it was <unk>
What about <unk>
<unk> What do you say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel it, because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances, you've thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
They get to the person in front of it and they could save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs in <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read to you for his letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he is with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike doesn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the 49 <unk> of his father on the 19th of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported me that the name of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the last day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end her.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful, <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who refer to hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a <unk> <unk> subject on the front line near the north tower near the north.
I put my <unk> <unk> and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When I saw it, she immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for her day to come back on that lane to give life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> I <unk>
"This is a new life."
But I asked him, "What was he made to <unk> and gave her hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They left me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin remains with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been correctly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
We give God for yourself.
I actually have a debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, she writes <unk> When I visited the General General of San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a part of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found myself in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, even though I finish his own pain, the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt someone else.
They just want their own chest pain.
Typically, this is only achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I responded to me in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents where I've been directly involved, only I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I <unk> my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the side of the side the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be used to do.
<unk> we can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inner side, you know what you are, and a question asks you, "How do you <unk>
I have to be something unique to that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had had since a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
So for complicated reasons, that I will go over later, when I look at this picture I think, you got it, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or by the beliefs of the people around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this shirt on his head.
And my mom said, "Why always take that shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex, and a mystery now.
Because of my success, I never get to share my story, not because I thought I will be a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have Mom, Dad and a family who just accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture, which celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I wish I would be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still using man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's a director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I got to her, she was responsible for the <unk> and the wardrobe and that night, I won in <unk> <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among more than 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was the queen of beauty of women -- but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my statement on the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you <unk> the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries in Thailand do and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., they need to be done before the name of the <unk> and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to drive a <unk> but to me I was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> his truth, but she <unk> he put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we do is a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in the injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just to me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no longer more than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Of course, first, thank you for all my <unk>
To my own support, to my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to <unk> young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and they told me that his parents couldn't take it, I would take my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that sometimes that task is not a block and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies, and tribal societies generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign through education defending her rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National Prize in peace, was very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I was born a little girl, her birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not for his father, nor for your mother.
<unk> gives her <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother became a lot of a little girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he is left at home and school is left at home and school of her brothers.
Even the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you realize that she comes home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you <unk> the code of that honor, the <unk> could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source code is not only the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and her happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm more of <unk> societies that is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts people's decisions and mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want.
If you beat it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If I was very young, you have to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious circle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like my newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and called my daughter that for her.
But when I was <unk> everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried out when she was four and a half years and a half years and a half years in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a big event for life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One near school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were <unk> the <unk> form of <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to see the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me with different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to lie in his personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've put all these good values in my school to girls and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in all the political, economic and social activities of social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and let them go to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the BBC, of the BBC, and she offered her same for New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and on the October nine of 2012, he was shot in his head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my wife -- "I must <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't get <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of truth, because of the cause of education, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to take a lot of words to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had harsh pains and hard headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please, don't be <unk>
It was an solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult times, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women -- it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't run his task.
They fight her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I <unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and, since that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined with the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google <unk> Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation,
You're still as smart or not?
Don't be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates very important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I wouldn't take anything, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to use it to live alive.
More than I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get to try to get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started testing different mixes and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the doses I could drastically change my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemists to a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought I was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various kinds of this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So he couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave myself a new appreciation for men and what they have to do, and since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is that we would match those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk> of ideas.
I think we think about it almost always in images, and that became my key point, how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me, is very simple: for most of us, mental imagery is fundamental to <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I was able to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> which is really <unk> and sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could pull out the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
Both of these used MRI technology, MRI imaging imaging -- and to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were able to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine that same image is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into brain fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were <unk> to create a large pool of reactions from the brain to video sequences in the video.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using just brain information, using it to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up <unk>
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the biggest brain scanning systems, available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection by images, including me, with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, the more <unk> magnets just offer little improvements in the resolution, not even billions as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI is to make really big magnets magnets -- right?
However, most recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns structured and <unk> on the radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio frequencies -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide it into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is the dream.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options that open this door.
Anyway, a year will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I will talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay achievement.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe is to tell some person for the first time you love it, or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever done in life.
And all <unk> is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is kind of universal.
It's <unk> and we don't like to happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> I didn't <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And to be the slope of the <unk> of my <unk> -- and I had my head <unk> I would ask myself a little bit of a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And it would produce uncomfortable silence at the table.
I <unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at her son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would go through it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was prepared -- and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> dates <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," the <unk>
Then I breathe down a little bit, and I went down the look and my backs and my back a girl in four years with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a bit deep back again, and I went out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a little bit confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, I am like you like to use a pink dress and you sometimes like to use a pink <unk>
I am more than a girl with a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me and he was paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was everything. Just "Oh, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why to get out of my closet was more difficult to get out of their his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
It's hard is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who declared him in bank <unk> is harder to tell you that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five years of five years you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We have to stop classifying what is hard to do with respect to what difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian <unk> to fight any four year-old <unk> that would go to coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my obscure <unk> <unk> my <unk> gay, and moving only one muscle is the most scary I've ever ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around.
It was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't start that <unk> you will kill you.
One of my <unk> <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time a lot of the guests who knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> and I walked around the tables and finally arrived where the friends were my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women lo and I went to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay narrative had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite singing show.
Our favorite answer Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I expected to show her support, to get me to know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else do you do to ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations are still without my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of every closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be you.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be <unk> by that.
And some of them can go out safe, they were injured by what they've done, but they never am sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark dark, <unk> <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine might think is as interesting as a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we would build a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth's intelligence or you can see the Earth, and they can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on the Earth, you would see a physical theory that would explain how, at some time in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be very finely <unk> to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, to developing universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom in order to do complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, it has several years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can get from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an assertion that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep online options with a force with you, with the diversity of possible <unk> diversity, even to an imminent time future, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom and keep the options.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with state-of-the-art entropy production, but actually actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that is inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, to play games of humans, and even winning money for them -- actions, all of it without the same one that would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here -- we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotics and technologies of human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to free the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> and keeping successfully the <unk>
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of <unk> discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to scale up at the world of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense for <unk> <unk> and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> successfully increasing assets under their development management exponentially.
This skill management skill skill is going to have broad applications in finance, and <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different sets of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all flow from an equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the <unk> robot, <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion -- the other way around.
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future futures is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do we look for targets are learning from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial <unk> is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the empowerment of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a spatial telescope which measures the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that you go.
The data collected by Kepler showing the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their star star.
So together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their suns.
Instead, this gives clues to whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the highest recorded.
<unk> and ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have gone rapidly our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the sector.
Now, as somebody very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that has shown this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites as the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now give not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a really terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests on thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets slowly drag a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some of us that Mars would expect for us to save this <unk> <unk> the only planet that we know is truly habitable Earth.
For a lot of whether I like the exploration of <unk> I'm in profound disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of the Titanic will be later in the <unk> --   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration and <unk> is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal goal, to try and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in areas and <unk> in the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found a lot of the existence of life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox, is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the importance of the importance to protect the origin of the planets that build this development.
It's arrogant to think that the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration can work together.
If we really believe that we believe in our ability to look at the problems of Mars for the global presence for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy job to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table in the dining table.
So he quickly tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all very close.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go back to my friend's friend's house, because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I <unk> out of my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I felt well stopped.
I am a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rate, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do -- systems that I could put in place that I would think bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen to be a bad thing, which is the odds that it is a total <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until one month after my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about breaking the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track track of the location of the important things, where the way the fish, where the fish are, where the fish are living in, where the tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and you could still find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved very evolved the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys for the car <unk> <unk>
So at home they would pick up a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you're <unk> with that stuff -- you will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take your cell phone, a picture of your credit stop license, <unk> <unk> <unk> themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can make it easier for <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to physician and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab, and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even if you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yeah, <unk> <unk>
But there's one question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you should think of what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not blame for the doctor, and if it's blame of somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently per <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of the <unk> my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular medicine, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And these include things that are <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to go to me, still so <unk>
But a moment.
Now remember, you don't think rather clearly.
So think about how to play this over time, so you don't have to build the chain of reasoning.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of it <unk> by the drug that you can help you with medicine.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with his physician.
Traditional medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent is part of the beginning of consent informed consent of the beginning of consent informed consent of the beginning of the informed consent of it.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the <unk> but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For surgery that is done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will make that conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life out of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the <unk> of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't respond very quickly. You could get to be lunch <unk> so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we have to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how you might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I <unk> the night in <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor became a <unk> of combination next to the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of emails that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree, there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands of <unk> and thousands of <unk> it might be never going to be a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the early 1800s, and over the time, it mixed with local signals, and the language was developed that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following a blindly foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't get covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, <unk> my thumb is not natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art zone there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that point, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
<unk> me more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a kind of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could well <unk> me and my artistic job, or I could be <unk>
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal to the same and become my voice.
So I am able to become relevant in today's society.
So in school, in school, the institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so that you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different parameters ...
If you broadcast a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, like if you get just a <unk> <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need 10 fingers to <unk> to express a clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If it would change in the <unk> it would create a completely different means.
Same thing happens with music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you fold it over and over again, it could become a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun goes out.
This is <unk>
If you <unk> it and you will look at the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how far the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> right now.
Watch <unk> hand. <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do it as much as your chest, as well as your chest, sort of like <unk> <unk> or <unk> right now.
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs all over the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one. Please, <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest -- but they carry it very differently.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start question what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear about learning music.
<unk> is a rich treasure trove of <unk> and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to encourage you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And it never knows, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you push everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found that adults also learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not really good to clean up the other people.
The time, I'm now adult and teach citizens and invention in Hong Kong of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And over the last few decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, and we were all networks, and we got these pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use these enormous <unk>
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny little rooms in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also be involved.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate tools tools feel great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to fix it in something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids were getting a lot of the robots.
Then we just created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we will transform light and online camera cameras and you fold it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see little bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it, even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're <unk> they're trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to research my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are children very well.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown color and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to research a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half Japanese and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that I started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> across the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant from the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If you go to the West coast, we can measure radiation from <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the day, it has to be very safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching the independent of other scientists, the land, the land, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> parents don't know it.
But every night you get to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take my job seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Along with them we discuss the data that we would take that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigmented data to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We could see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition -- the closest to nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear, and with the fishing aid of the area of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking array of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem on a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we become larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically can be built almost from all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become true with adult aid, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in mobility from the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs.
And the plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So early scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so I really can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one he thought it was.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool by Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all of the information that required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One is acting mostly like filter the other mostly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and architect working on the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the gene, between the assembly and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and <unk> shows on the two screens behind me.
My job at the most simple level tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and moving to growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why did it not be possible about 10 or even five years?
We live at a very special moment in history, a rare moment where they connect four disciplines that offers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with an <unk> <unk> and a <unk> base that someday not too far to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk> that shine on the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture Arabic, and has created a display where every aperture is unique size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from a single piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing -- we printed this layer and 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, and it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to me to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, <unk> leaves and <unk>
The entire tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the earth did grow trees with <unk> <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world that's made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects came to the <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we are looking for the material -- the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms.
We thought that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We were asking a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> <unk> we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the material properties about the march and create these structures made of a single half and a half percent long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves the dry tracks to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process, they used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of vibrating proteins, and if it extends even more, it <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of seed <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, they will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep the life on the <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control its flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metal <unk> new biological ecosystems inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
You convert light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help you to <unk> these bacteria and to embrace their function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material that we do with <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to get more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our own <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels living inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the living matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the tissue <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printing <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it by combining two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers to each other.
And this happens across the scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, it creates a tension, structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, have been manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we glue a small magnet on the head of a <unk> silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, by putting the silk worm into a flat patch on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it would <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape silk silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process into the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> <unk> and we put silk on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms into the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We were using silk worms to a online farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they were <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
Al <unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> give all this <unk>
And within two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious <unk> this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other filled with empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which leads us back to the beginning.
So here is a new era of design, a new age of creation, which brings us out of a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, that we make charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the English and the art and the art and online websites, he played the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, because there was dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I get stuck on it, and I get <unk> and I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this all into a career.
I thought I had a thing to pick up a thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we <unk> it from the culture.
You first ask us, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk>
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before the sleep.
Why?
Whether this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, not inspired to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adults well <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy editor once turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most children don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do in your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who's not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up and a lot of different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath for me to say.
It could help be <unk> in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the <unk> time, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any word that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you have to beat.
But what I've learned by talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there is huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data and travel, math and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all their background, can get access to a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is hard learning.
When we <unk> them <unk> we are going to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and come out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the finest sales mechanics when its <unk> and this ability helps to write compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to go to what you would get to you, even if at the end of it <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is the adaptability. That is to say, the ability to transform anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other fellow designer designer.  sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes a <unk> sometimes a teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company Company as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to engage them to meet the market needs, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, and learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose whether you're a <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with conventional <unk>
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, can dive deep and put ideas -- and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> most of them are <unk> to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with his many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> was taken to a psychiatric psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
Most amazing stuff.
If I had been living today, we could not give her more help than <unk> he gave her <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has made a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little has been moved on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years is going to go with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or to be loved with Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's <unk> cost 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death of all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that can't be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've spent less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it's more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain brain, compared with one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to spark a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by significantly reducing the hope of life and is always <unk>
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, it's been reduced the cables and waited the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside of them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to <unk> that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the current treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I <unk> this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, to do this.
The article is about a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try to test it as a last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to make more and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When did the last time you go back to another person?
And <unk>
We are <unk> these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like about him or it was very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you have ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really really struck of attention, the sure that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, so I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the <unk> column in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably may wonder, they continue to still go on.
And the reason I think we question this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the paper was published very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had led me to write about my experience in romantic love to my blog.
But a blog input can come to some hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would have probably some thousands of view.
And that found a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already been called the "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million pages, and I was like, to say something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing <unk> about their own experiences -- but another thing is to discover that <unk> life has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or share what every day they did every day for weeks was always, they were doing first the same question: still do together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
Several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I tried to test the study with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this care was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> if it was able to produce love -- not just a adventure, but love -- real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer me.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, particularly that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if I did it together or not, and then you get <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> interpersonal students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer after doing this. Several later studies, also used <unk> protocol as a way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it among members of the police and the community -- and they have used it among people who are <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you get away from the person with whom you get it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, it was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was basically all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took into science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could somehow get the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just looked for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to me then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I arrived.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can reasonably demand to me.
What I'm looking for of love is an <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people wonder when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story was told about the media about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate something of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are really willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And his content with an answer of <unk> or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we ask questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study that is designed for creating romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, it hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think about how many times we'd have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody as generous, and fun and actually have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of it.
And what I think about and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I actually didn't do.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he also will love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by lesbian in full mountain and in a certain way I became a forest <unk>
The city of New York City makes a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar dollar bill and a fork and a fork in a place in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go on tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered her and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more in the canvas, I think I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened in a way that it seemed to scale up size, as if it was <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow out the same thing that you do about a dead body, in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own <unk> of specimens from specimens from <unk>
First of all, you can have an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend up to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of the natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and then in another window, and I had all these windows together and that forming a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked work, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> in the garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's got twice a face, so it's 10 yards of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
Here is where creatures with <unk> animals are headed by <unk> lists for <unk> mass mass in the ocean.
The ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things you can find if they look very well on the ocean.
Anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> which keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a little bit.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> meter of <unk> a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail fire on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Its tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> in 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of human being, and they travel in a group of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get the <unk>
I'm going to see you all over the rest of the body, there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This has two heads and they're communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a <unk> a painter, a painter, a musician, a writer, a writer, a writer, a <unk> arm that spreading all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, which is this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill that this pill actually has an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill to take a pill is the most effective system for any drug <unk> effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs, they serve them to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and they increase the <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on their side side of their negative side because in the time that you take to get to the stream of it, it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it is where it is more important to HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get easily into the bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that is a waste of life running via the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Could we get the treatment straight to the virus tank, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and communication in diabetes, you can be used for anything else, including the <unk> transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open up or <unk> extremely small holes, opening up and closed almost the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
And they ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit and powerful beam laser on the cellular membrane living with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or on plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it's headed to the <unk>
Finally, the third head head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it frees it directly on the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to maintain the cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these <unk> agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation in violent <unk>
I do a field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an argument between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-governmental actors.
For example, of <unk> peace settlements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how they do, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle was not <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political <unk> a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
It was a complex <unk> machine, radio stations stations, television channels and Internet websites and strategies in social media.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising system but through <unk> business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put in <unk> professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state didn't <unk> and protection.
The <unk> of the Taliban in a Afghanistan were torn by war <unk> or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> may be understood also examined the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups just think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they fill gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participating in nonviolent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory -- they run all of their functions, collected all of their <unk> they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations and hybrids and the more weak are states, like in the Middle East and more <unk> and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that intelligence gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better than the <unk> we will understand better what incentives to offer to encourage the transition of violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and non-state actors, military power can win some fights, but it will not give us peace and stability.
In order to get these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that safety of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> tag is unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how they're treated women around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in <unk> which might be a <unk>
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and disgusting word.
I <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who are <unk> with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually a woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck by the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it was <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use <unk> and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for checks or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our own other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition -- and so much more.
We have to have to consider these differences and how we behave in the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad <unk>
I've got another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music -- <unk> <unk>
Even though the letter <unk> women and dirty <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> -- the classic <unk> <unk> that is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of trash, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and I can see the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies that I have a reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable to <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- the gay workers, the gay workers, the gay workers, <unk> in favor of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad <unk>
It also happens to happen.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will work by perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear of what that <unk> means not to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Take <unk> for example, or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in front of the word <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show. Look at this star of <unk> embracing feminism and knowing women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics began endless debates whether <unk> was not a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believe the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need a lot.
We go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, an more inclusive <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give us the point of action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists to be happier that they would be happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions do this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and very brave. I want to grow in a world world.
And they were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sports, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men who have heterosexual men who can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, and participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were going to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also <unk> to be including even more like us, to overcome barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top of the people in the power of directors and theater producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create meaningful and significant change.
We also can tell the courage our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, mainly because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after I all didn't help me believe that I could really matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown pigmented skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In a hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I argue the reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think about what I say and what I do without abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little courageous, when you need to be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit of a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be terrible for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but a lot of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, was not the paper that sparked the controversial article about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their own professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued to stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
NGOs as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people in the Center for Disease Control what's going on, which is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of it.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why they were so reduced by the beginning?
Why were the case of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a kindergarten psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to <unk> the people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> from panic for <unk> as when they weren't placed their favorite toy in their usual room without knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> who autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the leading authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism were very <unk>
For example, we will give that diagnosis to <unk> <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 children sent for other doctors to their doctor's office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
It <unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, have been carefully kept on a refrigerator, not <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I get two years old.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist thought that the theory of <unk> mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John and warm and <unk> and they had a young autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like <unk> without special education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Service Service, they needed more resources for the autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that was done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence in the general population.
It <unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more <unk> and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, to dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit in small paintings and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever notice these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article -- and then he got <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with classes of exercises with music, and children follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's who described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients as patients, Asperger's and <unk> their little teachers, and he went to help in developing methods of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a narrow continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they always been, watching this continuum of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until I said that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silent with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late '80s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't go on a broken <unk>
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked together to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> acting of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and fathers around the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they were introduced early clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it were, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines by the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful story, and <unk> a credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one of 68 <unk> children are in the spectrum, are right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical advances, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate different varieties of human cognition, <unk>
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is not working with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit in the details.
<unk> people are hard to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that he believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, and support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
